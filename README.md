# Weather Dashboard Project

This project is a weather dashboard application that provides real-time weather data for a specific location. It allows users to search for a city and view essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a five-day forecast. The application is designed to be user-friendly and displays information in an easy-to-read format.

## Features:
- **Search for City:** Users can enter the name of any city to get real-time weather data.
- **Current Weather:** Displays current weather information, including:
  - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Weather icon and description
- **5-Day Forecast:** Provides a forecast of the weather for the next five days.
- **Weather Icons:** Uses dynamic icons to represent different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rain, etc.).
- **Responsive Design:** The dashboard is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use:
1. **Launch the Application:** Navigate to the link provided to access the weather dashboard.
2. **Enter a City:** In the search bar at the top of the page, enter a city name (e.g., "Boston").
3. **View the Results:** After entering the city, the current weather and a 5-day forecast will be displayed below the search bar.

## Known Issues:
- **Bug with Weather Icon Display:** There's a bug with the display of one of the weather icons. This issue is related to resolution formatting, and I am working on fixing it with the latest programming practices.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeather API (for retrieving weather data)

## Future Updates:
- Enhanced UI for better user experience.
- Additional weather data like UV index and visibility.
- Improved error handling and user notifications when no valid city is entered.
